# Devon Erb - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a simple, responsive web application built using Go to serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, all in one place.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is designed to be minimalistic yet functional, highlighting:
- **About Me**: A short introduction to my background and interests.
- **Skills**: A section that lists my key technical skills, including front-end, back-end, and tools.
- **Projects**: A showcase of some of my significant projects, with a brief description and images.
- **Contact Information**: Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links for getting in touch.
